# LLM Tutor â€“ Notebook Guide

This Jupyter Notebook (`LlmTutor.ipynb`) is part of the [llm-projects](https://github.com/MahshadHashemi/llm-projects.git) repository. It serves as an interactive tutorial and experimentation space for working with large language models (LLMs), offering hands-on examples and explanations designed to help users understand key concepts in natural language processing and model behavior.

##  Notebook Overview

The `LlmTutor.ipynb` notebook includes:
- Introductory explanations of LLM architecture and workflows
- Code examples demonstrating tokenization, model loading, and inference
- Use cases such as prompt engineering, text generation, and fine-tuning basics
- Visuals and interactive cells to support step-by-step learning

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MahshadHashemi/llm-projects.git
cd llm-projects
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv llm-env
source llm-env/bin/activate      # On Windows: llm-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add the Environment to Jupyter (Optional)
To use your virtual environment in Jupyter:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=llm-env --display-name "Python (llm-env)"
```

Then select **Python (llm-env)** from the Jupyter kernel dropdown.

### 4. Run the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook LlmTutor.ipynb
```

## Requirements

The notebook relies on the following key libraries:
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `datasets` (optional)
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (for visuals)

## Repository Context

This notebook is part of a broader set of projects exploring LLMs. For more examples and resources, see:
